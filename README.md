II. Define problems & propose solutions

**Field of interest:** Beauty & spa services

**Context:**

- Beauty & spa services are becoming popular fast in big cities of Vietnam but shop owners do not focus on their booking sites enough.
- Most of these sites are only used to list services and prices and customers have to rely on another messaging app or call directly to make an appointment.
- Solution: A website and later a mobile app that helps customer explore services in full detail, allows them to custom services to their own likings and even try-on nail designs virtually, recommends optimal booking time and offers easy cancellation/adjustments on schedules.
